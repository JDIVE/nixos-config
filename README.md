### ‚¨áÔ∏è Install

#### üìú Script:

This is the easiest and recommended way of starting out. The script is not meant to allow you to change every option that you can in the flake or help you install extra packages. It is simply here so you can get my configuration installed with as little chances of breakages and then fiddle to your hearts content!

Simply copy this and run it:

```
nix-shell -p git curl
sh <(curl -L https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos/-/raw/main/install-zaneyos.sh)
```

#### ü¶Ω Manual:

Run this command to ensure Git & Vim are installed:

```
nix-shell -p git vim
```

Clone this repo & enter it:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/zaney/zaneyos.git
cd zaneyos
```

- *You should stay in this folder for the rest of the install*

Create the host folder for your machine(s)

```
cp -r hosts/default hosts/<your-desired-hostname>
```

**ü™ßü™ßü™ß Edit options.nix ü™ßü™ßü™ß**

Generate your hardware.nix like so:

```
nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config > hosts/<your-desired-hostname>/hardware.nix
```

Run this to enable flakes and install the flake replacing hostname with whatever you put in the hosts/<your-desired-hostname>/options.nix file:

```
NIX_CONFIG="experimental-features = nix-command flakes" 
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hostname
```

If the username is new, the new user will have the password be set for them as *password*. If you want to change it run a command replacing password with whatever you want to be your password. You then need to copy the output that it gives you like below into your hashedPassword in the system.nix file.

```
  mkpasswd -m sha-512 password

```

Now when you want to rebuild the configuration you have access to an alias called flake-rebuild that will rebuild the flake based of the flakeDir variable you set in options.nix!
